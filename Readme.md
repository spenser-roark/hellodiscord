This is a simple bot with only a few commands

To run:
1. node start.js
    * This assumes you have node installed, if not install node then run start.js
    * Note: You'll need to create and fill the tokens file with your own bot's token, other than that it should work out of the box

Dependencies:
* npm
* nodejs
    * Possibly nodejs-legacy
* discord.js
    * discordjs has quite a few dependencies but npm will tell you those when you attempt to install it
* babel
    * also babel-preset-es2015
    * babel-core
* tokens.js
    * As mentioned above you need to create this file as that's what we use for the bot token, I'm not pushing my token to this repo for obvious reasons.
